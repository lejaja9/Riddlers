# Riddlers!

Hi! Here is my repository for [538's weekly Riddler puzzles](https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/the-riddler/) and more! The files in this repo are my code for either 538's bite-sized *Riddler Express* or their more challenging *Riddler Classic* in addition to any riddles I come across (usually while running or chatting with my run friends). I explain my code for each riddle below. Enjoy!
