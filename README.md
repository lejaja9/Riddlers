# Riddlers!

Hi! Here is my repository for [538's weekly Riddler puzzles](https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/the-riddler/) and more! The files in this repo are my code for either 538's bite-sized *Riddler Express* and/or their more challenging *Riddler Classic* in addition to any riddles I come across (usually while running or chatting with my run friends). I explain my code for each riddle below. Enjoy!

* **Riddles.py**
⋅⋅⋅ While on a run, because I was sharing to him the Monte Carlo simulation I made the hour earlier (actually the 9/24 Riddler Classic), he gave me a teaser: approximate pi given a random number generator. Whatttttt?!?! Luckily, another friend casually mentioned that it was "throwing darts on a dartboard." For the next few miles, I was tortoured by this question, and near the end of the run it hit me: Area = pi*r^2. If r = 1, area would just equal pi.
